# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the displayed names of specific Our Team members across the site.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all user-visible occurrences of the team member name "Priya Sharma" with "Prayag Dhole" (including the OurTeamSection component data).
- Replace all user-visible occurrences of the team member name "Rajesh Kumar" with "Sagar Dhole" (including the OurTeamSection component data).
- Ensure every page/route that renders a team section reflects the updated names consistently.

**User-visible outcome:** Wherever an Our Team section appears on the site, the names display as "Prayag Dhole" and "Sagar Dhole" instead of the previous names, with no remaining old-name occurrences in team member listings/cards.
