  "summary": "Implemented a shared team data source with updated names and refactored OurTeamSection to render from it. However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that all other user-visible occurrences of the old names across the entire UI/pages have been updated or eliminated.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Replace all user-visible occurrences of \"Priya Sharma\" with \"Prayag Dhole\" and \"Rajesh Kumar\" with \"Sagar Dhole\" anywhere these team members are displayed in the UI (no remaining occurrences in team listings/cards).",
      "reason": "The diff shows updated names in the new shared team config and that OurTeamSection uses it, but it does not show a repo-wide replacement or updates to any other components/pages that might still hardcode the old names. Without evidence of searching/updating other potential render locations, we cannot confirm there are no remaining occurrences.",

      "requirement": "Ensure every page/route that renders a team section shows the updated names (no page shows the old names).",
      "reason": "Only OurTeamSection and the new config are shown as changed. The diff does not show updates to other pages/routes or other possible team section implementations (if any), so consistency across all pages that might include team info cannot be verified from the provided changes alone.",
